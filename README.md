# DATA-ANALYSIS-JOURNEY

### Empowering My Data Analysis Journey with LITA
---
### Overview
I embarked on an incredible journey with Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) and the Incubator Hub. This transformative experience has been insightful, challenging, and result-oriented, equipping me with cutting-edge data analysis skills.

As a data analyst, I've learned that data analysis is more than just numbers; it's about uncovering hidden stories. I've also mastered the art of data summarization, problem-solving, and decision-making. This documentation aims to share key insights and takeaways from my training.

### Data Source
The primary source of data for this documentation was obtained during the cause of the training  

### Tools Used
During my training, I learned to use the following tools:
- Microsoft Excel for Data entry, Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization
  - *Download Microsoft Excel [Click Here](https://www.microsoft.com)*
    
- SQL- Structured Query Language for data querying in a database and tables
  - *Download SQL [Click Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)*
    
- Power BI for stunning data visualizations
  - *Download PowerBI [Click Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)*
 
- Github for portfolio building

### Data Cleaning and Preparation 
I honed my analytical skills by learning and performing the following actions on a given data set during the training;

In Excel;
- Data loading & Inspection
- Data entry using Forms
- Validating data for error-free entry (Alt+AVV)
- Text data validation using Named Range
- Conditional analysis with IF & IFS functions (SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, MAXIFS, MINIFS)
- Text extraction using the LEFT, RIGHT & MID function
- Data Cleaning & Formatting (UPPER, LOWER, PROPER, TRIM, & AMPACANT functions)

In SQL;
- DDL (Data Definition Language) to CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE a table in a database
- DML (Data Manipulation Language) to INSERT, UPDATE values into a table
- DCL (Data Control Language) to GRANT/REVOKE permission to a database
- TCL (Transactional Control Language ) to ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT & COMMIT changes to a table 
- DQL (Data Query Language) has only one command 'SELECT' 
- Aggregate functions: SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNT
- SQL operators: Comparison, Arithmetic, Logical

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Here I learned to explore the data to answer some questions and gain insights about the data such as;
1. What is the grand total sales
2. What is the Overall sales trend
3. Which state/ region has the highest sales?

### Data Analysis
This is where we included some basic lines of codes and queries used during our analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE
```


#### Key Takeaway
In Summary, this journey has taught me:
- Data analysis is a problem-solving process
- Effective data visualization is crucial for decision-making
- SQL and Excel are powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis


Next Steps

As I continue to grow as a data analyst, I'm excited to:

- Explore advanced data visualization techniques
- Develop predictive modeling skills
- Collaborate on projects that drive business impact
